  <h1>Odin Recipes</h1>
  <div>
    <p id="goal">I was supposed to create a quick page with some recipes, and choosing them was actually much harder than creating the different pages. Here is a selection of three random food items that I enjoy either eating or making.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="intro">
    <p>Saltah might be my favorite meal from Yemen, it's almost like the national dish, and while it may seem quite simple and not that extraordinary, it brings loads of emotional connection in addition to being a meal that's shared, a meal that bring people together, and a meal that reminds me of the dearest country to my heart and its wonderful people.</p>
    <p>Yogurt cake is usually the base for any birthday cake I bake for my kids, and then I add a few alterations of my own to it.</p>
    <p>And finally, lasagna, honestly I don't know, I like it, but couldn't think of a third one that I connect with <em>and</em> that is easy to write here.</p>
