  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p id="description">Saltah is the national dish of Yemen, featured on the Sanaa episode. It’s a brown meat stew, cooked and served in a hot stone bowl that keeps it boiling hot for you.  Everyone has their own version of saltah, lamb, beef, chicken and even vegan.  It’s traditionally simmered over a flame, but it sounds like it can be nicely done in your instant pot.  Saltah can have potatoes, eggs, rice, tomatoes, peppers, onions, whatever you have on hand.  It’s generally straightforward: simmer your aromatics, add your spices like cumin, coriander and turmeric, then brown your meat, add water and any additional veggies, and simmer.</p>
  
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 lb lamb stew, cut into pieces</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
      <li>½ onion, chopped</li>
      <li>½ green hot pepper, chopped</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground cumin</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground coriander</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon turmeric</li>
      <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
      <li>6 tablespoons cooked rice</li>
      <li>A few tablespoons of hulba</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>In a pressure cooker, sauté garlic, onion and hot pepper in a little oil until the onion is translucent.</li>
      <li>Add cumin, coriander, turmeric and salt. Add the lamb to the onion mixture. Brown the meat for 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>Add about 5 cups (1,25 liter) of water to the mixture and lock the pressure cooker. Bring the cooker up to pressure, and reduce heat to low/medium to keep the pressure steady. Cook for about 40 minutes. The meat should be tender and break easily.</li>
      <li>Pour the meat stew in a stone pot (haradha) or a cast iron skillet. Add the rice and cook until bubbly. At that time, add the beaten eggs, then a few spoonfuls of whipped hulba and serve hot with Yemeni flat bread or pita.</li>
    </ol>
